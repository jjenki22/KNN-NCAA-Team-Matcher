## Sports Analytics: College Basketball Clustering Model

We created a model that clusters college basketball teams from 2008 to 2019 to determine the teams that are similar based on various statistics. This project used data from the following pages on Ken Pomeroyâ€™s website: homepage, four factors, miscellaneous team stats: defense, and various team stats: offense. This clustering model utilizes the machine-learning algorithm of k-nearest neighbors to group the teams. We expect this user interface to provide value for two groups. First, we believe that this tool will help college coaches when scouting and preparing for an unfamiliar opponent. They can enter the team and identify if they have previously faced a similar one. Knowing this, they can then prepare in a similar manner for the unfamiliar opponent as they did for a previously faced one. From an entertainment perspective, we believe that avid college basketball fans will enjoy navigating these pages.
