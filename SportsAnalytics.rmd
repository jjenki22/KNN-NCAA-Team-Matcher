## Sports Analytics College Basketball Clustering Model

We created a model that clusters college basketball teams from 2008 to 2019 to determine the teams that are similar based on basketball statistics.This project, used data from the following pages on Ken Pomeroyâ€™s website: homepage, four factors, miscellaneous team stats: defense, and various team stats: offense. This model utilizes k-means clustering techniques to group the teams. We believe that this project will be most beneficial to two groups. First, we believe that this tool will help college coaches when scouting an unfamiliar opponent. They can enter the team and identify if there are any teams similar to their opponent that they have previously faced. Then, they can go back to the film and see what they did well and what they did not do well against the team that matches their upcoming opponent. Also, we believe that avid college basketball fans. Users will be able to compare teams throughout time and identify teams with similar performance to their selected team.
